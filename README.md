### Hints

- one tab is enough, there is no benefit by using more than one browser tab
- To prevent that the bot will stuck (e.g. caused by internet connection errors like timeout/server unreachable) you can use [AutoRefresh](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-refresh/ifooldnmmcmlbdennkpdnlnbgbmfalko) with 30 or 45min configured.
